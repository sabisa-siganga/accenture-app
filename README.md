# Brand Landing Page using React

This is a landing page I designed for brands, implemented with React.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** I utilized Bootstrap to ensure the landing page looks great on various devices and screen sizes.

- **TypeScript:** The codebase is written in TypeScript, which enhances code maintainability by providing self-documenting benefits and type annotations.

- **Maintainable Styling:** I've used SASS to keep the styling of the landing page maintainable, organized, and easy to update.

- **React Slick Slider:** To showcase case studies and responsiveness, I integrated React Slick. It's simple to set up and offers powerful settings for responsive design.

- **Reusable Components:** I've created a set of reusable components to enhance code maintainability and reusability throughout the project.
